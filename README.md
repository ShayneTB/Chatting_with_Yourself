# Chatting_with_Yourself
A little project regarding chatbots and the creation of my very own chatbot!

This project came about due to Carnegie Mellon University's "Practical Data Science" course. Please see the PDS_Final_Project for
the first part of the project, and the soon to be added Phase_2 where the actual chatbot is built and deployed.

Note: Due to the sensitive nature of the personal dialogue data, we have included a link to an external dialogue dataset with instructions
on how to parse individual's conversations from there. This will allow others to replicate what we have done, although we encourage all
that are interested to follow the first part of the project to generate a corpus of their own conversation history... It can be truly
enlightening to learn about your own speaking habits and history!
